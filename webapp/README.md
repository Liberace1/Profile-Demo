# WebApp Architecture Overview

## Introduction
The WebApp project is a full-stack web application built using React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. It provides functionality for managing skills, courses, and user profiles.

## Architecture
The architecture of the WebApp project consists of two main components:

### Frontend (React): 
The frontend of the application is built using React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allows for the creation of dynamic and responsive UI components.
### Backend (Node.js):
The backend of the application is built using Node.js, a JavaScript runtime environment. Node.js is used to create the API server that handles requests from the frontend and interacts with the database.

# Code Structure
The code for the WebApp project is organized as follows:

### Frontend (React):
The frontend code is located in the src directory.
Components such as App.js, CongratulationsModal.js, and others are responsible for rendering the user interface.
React Router is used for client-side routing to navigate between different views of the application.
Styling is done using CSS files such as App.css and index.css.

### Backend (Node.js):
The backend code is located in the src/server directory.
The main server file server.js sets up the Express.js server and defines the API routes.
The package.json file lists the dependencies required for the backend.
API Server
The backend server exposes API endpoints that the frontend interacts with to perform CRUD operations on data such as skills, courses, and user profiles. These endpoints are accessible via localhost on a specific port (e.g., localhost:5000).

### Getting Started
To run the WebApp project locally:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install dependencies for both the frontend and backend using npm.
Start the backend server by navigating to the src/server directory and running npm start.
Start the frontend by navigating to the src directory and running npm start.
Access the application in your web browser at localhost on the specified port.

### Conclusion
The WebApp project demonstrates how to build a full-stack web application using React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. It provides a structured architecture for managing data and handling user interactions.
